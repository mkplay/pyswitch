pySwitch
========

Switch easily between different versions of Python on Windows.

**pySwitch**

- works from the command line
- has no dependencies
- keeps your registry clean

How To Use
----------

1. Download pySwitch
2. Pick one from the "config_samples" and rename it to "config.txt"
3. Edit the config to fit your needs
4. Run pySwitch.bat as administrator
5. Choose your desired option

The changes will take effect immediately except prior opened Windows command-line shells (cmd.exe) -
the Windows prompts keep the old values "by nature".

Issues/ToDos

- Add some documentation/commenting
- Eval global PATH vs. local PATH
